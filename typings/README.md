Angular 2:
- Angular 2 is compatible with diffrent languages
  - one of the biggest changes with Angualr 2 is multi language support
    - Dart
    - TypeScript
    - ES6
    - ES5
- It has way less concepts to learn than Angular 1.x
- HTMl syntax is lighter and does not have any ng- prefixes
- It uses a new change detection mechanism ( with the help pf Zone.js) that removes the need for $scope.$apply() or $timeout workarounds from 1.x
- Writing directives was complex in Angular 1.0 - it becomes much easier in Angular 2, where directives are called components.
- Scopes are bindings are also easier to understand.
- it is much faster than 1 ( 3 to 5 times faster)
- It's a brand new code base - Angular 1 started in 2008
- Better caching and pre-compilation of templates
- The new component router is both, more powerful and more flexible
- Simpler APIs and learning curve
- Plays well with Angular 1.x
